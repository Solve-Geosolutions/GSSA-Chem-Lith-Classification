# GSSA-Chem-Lith_Classification

This repository contains the code required to follow the 'Datarock Applied Machine Learning in Geosciences' course and accompanying presentation.  

the notebook 'code/GSSA-chem-lith-model.ipynb' demonstrates concepts covered in the course notes including:

Data Preparation,
Solving Imbalanced Class problems,
Spatial Validation approach and,
Model Explainability.  

The Data, which can be accessed in 'data/' is a filtered version of open-file XRF Chemistry data provided by the Geological Survey of South Australia (GSSA).  It comprises > 1000 rows of XRF chemistry data and lithology labels from 14 drill holes throughout the Gawler Ranges of South Australia (see below).
